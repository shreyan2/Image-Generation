# Image-Generation
Using DCGAN to generate images from CIFAR-10 dataset.
I have used the datasets modeule available in keras to load cifar-10 dataset.

## The models used:
In the baseline GAN, only dense(fully connected) layers have been used. To stabilize training and optimize the results, I have made use of CNNs to create a DCGAN hence improving the output.
